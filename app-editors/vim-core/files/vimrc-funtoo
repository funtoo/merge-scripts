" deviating only where it makes sense

set bs=2                " Allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set ai                  " Auto-indenting off to allow pasting to work by default 
set history=50          " keep 50 lines of command history
set ruler               " Show the cursor position all the time
set noexpandtab
set ts=4 sw=4

set viminfo='20,\"500   " Keep a .viminfo file.

" Don't use Ex mode, use Q for formatting
map Q gq

" When doing tab completion, give the following files lower priority. You may
" wish to set 'wildignore' to completely ignore files, and 'wildmenu' to enable
" enhanced tab completion. These can be done in the user vimrc file.
set suffixes+=.info,.aux,.log,.dvi,.bbl,.out,.o,.lo

" When displaying line numbers, don't use an annoyingly wide number column. This
