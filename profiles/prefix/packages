# Gentoo Base Prefix Profile

# NOTE: THIS IS THE BASE PROFILE FOR *ANY* PREFIX BASED OPERATING SYSTEM.
# NO MODIFICATIONS MAY BE MADE TO THIS FILE WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION.  IF
# YOU ARE CREATING A NEW PROFILE, YOU SIMPLY NEED TO INHERIT THIS BASE
# PROFILE IN YOUR PROFILE DIRECTORY'S "parent" FILE.

# Read the descriptions of ../base/packages for some explanation

# This file removes everything from the base profile which is not
# necessary/desired in a prefix environment.
