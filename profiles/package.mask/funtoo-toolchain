# Mask new versions for caution, and these should all
# be tested and upgraded together. This helps ensure that
# any new glibc upgrade will be built against any upgraded
# linux-headers.

# Also note that these new masks are relatively "loose".
# They will allow for rev bumps to get to users, but not
# wholesale new ${PV}.
